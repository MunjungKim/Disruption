# Citation network dataset


In order to evaluate the influence of potential confounding factors, such as the number of citations and references, on the disruption index (or distance index), we calculate the same disruption indexes on randomized citation networks.

The original citation network is located in the folder:

`/data/original/`

The randomized citation networks can be found in the folder:

`/data/random/random_{i}`

Here, i denotes different randomized citation networks.
